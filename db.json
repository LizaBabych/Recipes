        "Prepare the Ingredients and Wasabi\nPrepare a baking sheet with foil or use a nonstick baking sheet. Thoroughly rinse produce and pat dry. Scrub and slice cucumber into long ¼\" strips. Rinse shrimp and pat dry and halve lengthwise. Cut cream cheese into 2\" long, ¼\" thick pieces. If cream cheese is too sticky to cut, place in freezer for 10 minutes to firm. Mix wasabi powder and 1 Tbsp. water together in a bowl to make the wasabi for dipping.",
        "Cook the Rice\nBring a medium pot with rice and 2 cups of water to a soft boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and fold in the rice vinegar. Spread rice on baking sheet to cool.",
        "Cook the Shrimp\nIn a medium pot, warm 4 cups of water over medium heat. When water comes to a low simmer, add the shrimp. Cook for 2-3 minutes. When pink and firm to the touch, remove shrimp from the water and cool with cold running water.",
        "Roll the Maki\nPrepare a small dish of cold water. Place nori wrappers smooth side down on a cutting board. Wet fingers in dish and place a small handful of cooled sushi rice on the nori wrappers. Spread rice to cover the paper, leaving a 1\" of paper at the end of the roll. Place even amount of shrimp, chives, cream cheese, and cucumber in a straight line. Dip your fingers in the water dish and wet the end of the nori wrapper without rice with a small amount of water so the roll will close and stick together. Slowly roll the sushi, making sure to keep some tension so it rolls tight and no ingredients fall out. Repeat for second roll. We send you extra nori wrappers in the event a few break apart. This recipe makes 4+ rolls.",
        "Plate the Dish\nUsing a sharp knife, cut maki rolls into 1\" rounds. Place maki on a plate, laying each piece against each other on an angle. Serve with wasabi, Sriracha, and soy sauces."
